        by and between \textbf{\engineerName{}} (hereafter referred to as the ``Engineer''),
        and \textbf{TechnoPark Corp.} acting under the brand name

        verbal: either by phone or in person, magnetic, photographic,
        optical or other form and whether now existing or hereafter
        created, including, without limitation to, all trade secrets,
        know-how, names and contacts of employees and partners,
        technology, data, computer programs, processes, methods,
        operational procedures, plans, strategies or results, and other
        information of a similar nature that is not generally disclosed
        by the Discloser to the public.
        Confidential Information shall not include any information which
            (a) is proven by written evidence to have been in the Discloser's possession prior to disclosure by the Holder;
